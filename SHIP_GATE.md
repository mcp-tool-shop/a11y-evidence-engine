---

## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No secrets, tokens, or credentials in source or diagnostics output (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No telemetry by default — state it explicitly even if obvious (2026-02-27)

### Default safety posture

- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: read-only scanner — no destructive actions, no kill/delete/restart capabilities
- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` File operations constrained to known directories (2026-02-27) — reads input args only, writes only to --out path
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27) — emitError() with typed codes
- [x] `[cli]` Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 user error · 2 runtime error · 3 partial success (2026-02-27) — 0=clean, 2=findings, 3=failure
- [x] `[cli]` No raw stack traces without `--debug` (2026-02-27) — catch block emits structured error
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
- [ ] `[vscode]` SKIP: not a VS Code extension

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` `--help` output accurate for all commands and flags (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: single-output CLI — no configurable logging levels needed
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: simple scanner tool, not complex enough for ops handbook

## D. Shipping Hygiene

- [x] `[all]` `verify` script exists (test + build + smoke in one command) (2026-02-27)
